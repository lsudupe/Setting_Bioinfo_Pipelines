# Setting_Bioinfo_Pipelines

This repository provides a comprehensive suite of bioinformatics pipelines tailored for various high-throughput sequencing data types. The goal of this project is to serve as an educational resource for a course that covers the following data types and methodologies:

- RNA-seq
- ATAC-seq
- Single-cell sequencing
- Multiome analysis
- DNA methylation analysis
- Spatial Transcriptomics

Each directory within this repository is devoted to one of these data types, containing relevant scripts, workflows, and example data.

## Course Syllabus

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a different aspect of bioinformatics analysis:

### RNA-seq

- Quality control and preprocessing of count data
- Quantification of gene expression
- Differential expression analysis
- Functional enrichment and pathway analysis

### ATAC-seq

- Data preprocessing and quality control
- Peak calling and annotation
- Integration with gene expression data
- Visualization of ATAC-seq data

### Single-Cell Sequencing

- Preprocessing of scRNA-seq data
- Clustering and identifying cell populations
- Differential expression analysis in single cells
- Pseudotime analysis

### Multiome Analysis

- Data integration strategies
- Multiomics data visualization
- Case studies in multiomics analysis

### DNA Methylation Analysis

- Processing methylation data
- Identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs)
- Integration with gene expression data
- Methylation's role in gene regulation

### Spatial Transcriptomic Analysis

- Processing ST data
- Quality Control
- Differential Expression Analysis
- Comparison report


## Data

For the RNA-seq part of the course, we will utilize the dataset with GEO accession number GSE198256. 

## Projects

Both individual and group projects are included in this course to provide hands-on experience with real-world data. These projects reinforce the concepts and techniques covered in the lectures and practical sessions.

## Directory Structure

Each data type has its directory:

- `RNA-seq/`
- `ATAC-seq/`
- `Single-cell/`
- `Multiome/`
- `Methylation/`
- `Spatial Transcriptomics/`
